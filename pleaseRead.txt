Hi welcome to my project!
I uploaded this to github as well 
https://github.com/camdenfritz/Create-Project-Final
I would give an example execution but that would require me sharing my ikon pass information
which i am not comfortable doing and it would not work since I have maximized my reservation days. 
If this is an issue please reach out but I believe it shouldnt be too difficult finding someone with an ikon pass :)
A chrome driver needs to be downloaded as well as pip install selenium, all in the readme
My last request is to minimize sharing this code as I'd like to abuse it personally and if
ikon catches on they may make changes to their website, and it would be shame if I had to go back to 
checking the website every hour.
Hope you enjoy the project, if you have any difficulties reach out to me
